Solar Power Potential of Buildings using ArcGIS
**Solar Energy Potential Estimation of Buildings using ArcGIS**

Welcome to my Solar Energy Potential Estimation project! This repository showcases my expertise in utilising ArcGIS for accurately assessing solar energy potential in buildings. 

**Key Features:**
- Leveraged DSM, building footprints, and the Area Solar Radiation tool in ArcGIS for precise estimation of solar power potential.
- Developed robust algorithms and workflows for data processing, image classification, and spatial analysis.
- Conducted thorough validation exercises, comparing model results with real-world solar power generation data.

**Highlights:**
- Accurate estimation of solar power potential by considering shading effects, topography, and building characteristics.
- Detailed documentation of methodologies, providing insights into the project's technical aspects.
- Clean and well-organized codebase, ensuring easy understanding and potential for further development.
